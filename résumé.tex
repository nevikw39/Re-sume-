\section{Leaderships \& Awards}

\subsection{Programming Contests}

%My voyage of competitive programming rooted in high school. I continue to compete in several prominent and prestigious programming contests ever since I was a college freshman. Among these contests, not only did I perfect and elaborate my programming proficiency but also learnt the authentic true value of \textbf{teamwork}.

I started competitive programming since high school. Here are some prominent and prestigious contests I participated during college:

\begin{itemize}
\item 2021 National Collegiate Programming Contest Final (Taiwan), team \emph{Dkjistra}, \textbf{Honorable Mention}, ranked 28\textsuperscript{th}.
\item 2021 International Collegiate Programming Contest Asia Taipei Regional, Team \emph{Dkjistra}, \textbf{Silver Award}, ranked 30\textsuperscript{th}.
\item 2022 National Collegiate Programming Contest Final (Taiwan), team \emph{DebugCat Capoo}, \textbf{Honorable Mention}, ranked 23\textsuperscript{rd}.
\item 2022 International Collegiate Programming Contest Asia Taoyuan Regional, team \emph{DebugCat Capoo}, \textbf{Bronze Award}, ranked 39\textsuperscript{th}.
\item 2023 National Collegiate Programming Contest Final (Taiwan), team \emph{DebugCat Capoo}, \textbf{4\textsuperscript{th} Place Award}, ranked 14\textsuperscript{th}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Competed with 6 teams on site at Hamburg, Germany
\item Won the \textbf{2\textsuperscript{nd} place}
\end{itemize}
\item 2024 ISC Student Cluster Competition\footnote{\url{https://www.hpcadvisorycouncil.com/events/2024/student-cluster-competition}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Competed with 7 teams on site at Hamburg, Germany
\item Won the \textbf{2\textsuperscript{nd} place}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%HPC competitions, or cluster competitions, are a sort of competitions with tasks required participants to solve with the cluster supercomputers. Advised by Prof. Jerry Chou and some experienced senior students, 4 sophomores and 2 juniors teamed up and got along with HPC from scratch. Since I had more background knowledge and learnt fast, I was elected the team \textbf{leader}. I took up the responsibilities and spared no effort to maintain our team.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 4 sophomores \& 2 juniors teamed up
%\item Elected as the leader due to richer background knowledge \& ability to learn faster
%\item Took on responsibilities and maintained the team
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsubsection{2022 HiPAC (Taiwan)}
%
%%We registered the first High Performance Application Competition organised by NCHC Taiwan. Our proposal was to profile and optimise the efficiency of calculating future green energy mechanisms \textbf{parallellly} across 16 nodes of the cluster supercomputer \emph{Taiwania 3} by the electronic-structure software Quantum \textsc{Espresso} and we won the \textbf{3\textsuperscript{rd} place}.

%\item Profiled and optimized the efficiency of calculating future green energy mechanisms using Quantum \textsc{Espresso} software across 16 nodes of the supercomputer \emph{Taiwania 3}
%\item Won \textbf{3\textsuperscript{rd} place} in the competition
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsubsection{2022 APAC HPC-AI Competition}
%
%%The six-month long Asia-Pacific High-Performance Computing AI Competition\footnote{\url{https://www.hpcadvisorycouncil.com/2022_APAC_HPC_AI\%20Competition\%20Result_Announcement_PR.pdf}}, co-organised by HPC-AI Advisory Council, NSCC Singapore and NCI Australia and involved 25 teams from 12 countries, included tasks focusing on three critical issues that leverage the power of HPC and AI to develop solutions to human health and environmental sustainability.
%%
%%We improve the throughput of communications between 16 \textsf{NVIDIA V100} across 4 GPU nodes of the cluster supercomputer \emph{Gadi} about 2.7 times via Active Message scheme of \textsf{UCX} Rendezvous protocol and some optimisation. The accuracy of deep-learning-based DNA sequence fast decoding was increased by adopting suitable model and the training time was reduced by running on \textsf{NVIDIA A100}.
